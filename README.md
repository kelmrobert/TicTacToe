## 🎯 About The Game

Welcome to TicTacToe Impossible - where Player 2's dreams come to die! This isn't your grandmother's Tic-Tac-Toe; it's a deviously crafted game where Player 1 reigns supreme through the power of... let's call it "strategic advantage." 😈

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay (with a twist!)
- 🏃‍♂️ Running instructions button (literally - it runs away!)
- 🔄 Mysteriously disappearing O's
- 🏆 100% win rate for Player 1
- 🎭 Fair play is merely an illusion

## 🎪 How It "Works"

1. Player 1 places their X wherever they want
2. Player 2 attempts to place their O
3. The game employs advanced "fairness adjustment algorithms" (totally not cheating)
4. Player 1 wins... every single time!

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

```javascript
if (player2.aboutToWin) {
    reality.adjust();
    fairness.disable();
    player1.grantVictory();
}
```
